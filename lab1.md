Upon opening VSCode, you should be greeted with a welcome page helping you navigate folders and open files. From here, we proceed to our next step.
## Remotely Connecting
In order to access the server, you need to know your account name and password. You can find it at https://sdacs.ucsd.edu/~icc/index.php using the account lookup feature.
