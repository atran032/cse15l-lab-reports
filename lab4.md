# Lab Report 4
## Step 4

Keys pressed: `<up>, <enter>`

Logging into ieng6 was the first thing I did on my terminal. Therefore, one up arrow accessed the command `ssh cs15lsp23fe@ieng6.ucsd.edu` and enter ran it.
## Step 5

Keys pressed: `<ctrl>+c, <RMB>, <enter>`

I copied the command `git clone https://github.com/ucsd-cse15l-s23/lab7` from the lab page by highlighting it and using the copy shortcut. Then, in the terminal, I right clicked to paste it.
## Step 6

Keys pressed: `"cd lab7", <enter>, <up><up><up><up><up>, <enter>`

I typed in `cd lab7` and `<enter>` to change my directory to the correct one. Then, I pressed the up arrow 5 times because the command `bash test.sh` was 5 commands up in the history.
## Step 7

Keys pressed: `"vim ListExamples.java", "?index1", <enter>, "e", "x", "i", "2", <esc>, ":wq", <enter>`

The first command opens vim on the specified file, which contains the error. While in vim, I jumped to the location of the error with `?index`, which searches for matching terms from the bottom up. `<enter>` takes me out of it, `e` jumps to the last character, which is "1", `x` deletes it, `i` activates insert mode where I replaced it with "2" and exited. `:wq` saves the changes and closes vim from the file.
## Step 8

Keys pressed: `<up><up>, <enter>`

Having ran the tests before, I only needed to search up the history twice until it accessed the command `bash test.sh` and ran it with `<enter>`. Both tests pass with no errors now.
