## Researching Commands

The **grep** command is used to search text files and find lines which contain a given string. Here, we'll be exploring some of the interesting things you can do with **grep** and some ways you might use them. I give special thanks to ChatGPT for helping me find all of the following.

First, the *or* operator can be used by typing a vertical bar between two strings. It must be formatted starting with a backslash with backslashes following every string. Surround all strings with a parenthesis and vertical bars in between, like so:
    
    $ grep "\(word1\|word2\)" file.txt
    
The *or* operator returns all lines which contain either the first string or the second.

    $ grep "\(accident\|driver\)" government/Alcohol_Problems/Session3-PDF.txt
        the medical conditions, accidents, and injuries that cause visits
        and accidents" to a 65% reduction in "accidental and violent
        ...
        alcohol health worker in an accident and emergency
        drinking, riding with a drinking driver, and drinking and driving.
    
It can also be used more than twice, in case you need to look for more than a pair of words.

    $ grep "\(serotonin\|ligand\|receptor\)" biomed/1471-2091-3-15.txt
        Sequence homology between the serotonin type 3 receptor
        receptor (nAChR), the GABA
        A receptor and the glycine receptor
        this superfamily of ligand gated ion channels [ 1 2 3 ] .
            
The *or* operator is practical for it's ability to search for related terms. For example, you may want to find lines containing "code" or "program." In such situations, **grep** and a vertical bar should be used.

Second, you can use the **-v** option to display only lines which do not contain a given string. 

    $ grep -v "word" file.txt
    
By putting **-v** after **grep**, you filter out any occurrence of that string.

    $ grep -v "\(Stutter\|stutter\)" plos/journal.pbio.0020046.txt
        centuries; earliest descriptions probably date back to the Biblical Moses' â€œslowness of
        in all cultures and ethnic groups (Andrews et al. 1983; Zimmermann et al. 1983), although
        prevalence might differ. Insofar as many of the steps in how we produce language normally
        genetic and neurobiological approaches are now giving us clues to causes and better
        treatments.
